Unfortunately, it is quite 'normal' behaviour because they were afraid of making mistakes. So they feel they need to clarify with peers anyway. I did mention that they could ask me any questions anytime. 
I gave 40 for the compliance of the first task. I noticed during the conversation, they did not start speaking even when they are given time to. I think that happened because they were very shy to start first. They only started talking maybe on 1 last minute out of 2.5 minute time they had. So not everyone had a chance to talk.

I gave 80 for the compliance of other tasks.
The next task which was the individual singing. I noticed they gained more confidence but some started to sing together. 
When the tasks were about doing activities together, they can do them very well.

Reflecting from this, I realized that this behaviour is quite normal. Growing up I noticed that people did not want to start first in discussion, passive in class, and were afraid of becoming the spotlight (afraid of making mistakes). 

When the participants were competing the last part of the survey, there was a blackout. However, I kept observing them and they stayed focus on completing it. When they finished, they left the room one by one."
